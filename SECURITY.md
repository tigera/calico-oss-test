# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Project Calico follows an N-2 support model driven by the release
cadence: the latest release and the two preceding minor lines receive
fixes, and end-of-life dates are published per-release in the security
advisories feed. Backports outside that window require a maintainer
sponsor and a documented CVE.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please follow responsible disclosure best practices and [Tigera's Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.tigera.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) when submitting
security vulnerabilities.  **Do not** create a GitHub issue or pull 
request because those are immediately public. Instead:

*  Email [psirt@projectcalico.org](psirt@projectcalico.org).
*  Report a private [security advisory](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/security/advisories)
  through the GitHub interface.

Please include as much information as possible, including the
affected version(s) and steps to reproduce.

## Bug Bounty

Project Calico does not currently operate a bug bounty programme. Researchers who would like to be acknowledged for valid reports can request a public mention in the release notes for the version that ships the fix.

## Third Party Vulnerabilities

When using automated security scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Grype, Docker Scout), CVEs may be flagged in Calico container images due to vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Before submitting any reports related to these findings, check the [Tigera VEX repository](https://github.com/tigera/vex).
The repository provides analysis of third-party CVEs that may appear in Calico images, including whether they are exploitable or applicable to our supported versions. Reviewing this information helps avoid duplicate reports and offers context for scanner-detected issues.
